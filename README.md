This is an AI-powered board project designed to enhance collaboration and creativity. The project includes a landing page, login and sign-up functionality, a profile page, and a dynamic board canvas page.

The profile page provides an organized list of all the boards youâ€™ve created, allowing you to either open an existing board or create a new one.

Once you enter a board, you are presented with an interactive board canvas. This canvas supports intuitive features like panning, zooming in, and zooming out. You can add sticky notes, and each note comes with a toolbar that lets you customize its appearance by changing its color or formatting the text. You can also connect two sticky notes by pressing and holding on the circular edge-holders and dragging it from one sticky note to the edge-holder of other sticky notes

Additionally, a chat icon is located at the bottom-right corner. Clicking it opens a chatbox where you can describe your sticky notes or request a graph. Powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT API, the AI agent generates a tailored graph for you, seamlessly integrating it into the board.

This project combines visual creativity with AI-driven insights, making it a versatile tool for personal and team projects alike.
